The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes. In the
example of {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the
object `question`. Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup â€“ which works, in this
case. If attribute lookup had failed, it would've tried a list-index lookup.
- Dictionary lookup: {{ my_dict.key }}
- Attribute lookup: {{ my_object.attribute }}
- List-index lookup: {{ my_list.0 }}

Method-calling happens in the {% for %} loop: question.choice_set.all is interpreted as
the Python code question.choice_set.all(), which returns an iterable of Choice objects
and is suitable for use in the {% for %} tag.

Since you defined the name argument in the path() functions in the polls.urls module,
you can remove reliance on specific URL paths defined in your url configurations by
using the {% url %} template tag.

<h1>{{ question.question_text }}</h1>

{% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}

<form action="{% url "polls:vote" question.id %}" method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
	<input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}">
	<label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br>
{% endfor %}
<input type="submit" value="Vote">
</form>

The value of each radio button is the associated question choice's ID. The name of each
radio button is "choice". That means, when somebody selects one of the radio buttons
and submits the form, it'll send the POST data choice=# where # is the ID of the
selected choice.

All POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %}
template tag to protect against Cross Site Request Forgeries.
