## Create a project

- `django-admin startproject mysite`
  - creates a `mysite` directory in your current directory
- Files:
  - outer `mysite/`: Container for your project
  - `manage.py`: command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project
  - inner `mysite/`: the actual Python package for your project; its name is the Python package name youâ€™ll need to use to import anything inside it
  - `mysite/__init__.py`: an empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package
  - `mysite/settings.py`: settings/configuration for this Django project
  - `mysite/urls.py`: URL declarations for this Django project
  - `mysite/asgi.py`: entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers
  - `mysite/wsgi.py`: entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers

## Run the development server

- `python manage.py runserver`
- by default, the runserver command starts the development server on the internal IP at port 8000
- to change the server's port: `python manage.py runserver 8080`

## Create an app

- Project
  - a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website
  - can contain multiple apps
- App
  - a Web application that does something, e.g., a small poll app
  - can be in multiple projects
  - can live anywhere on your Python path
- `python manage.py startapp polls`
- Files:
  - `polls/`
    - `__init__.py`
    - `admin.py`
    - `apps.py`
    - `migrations/`
      - `__init__.py`
    - `models.py`
    - `tests.py`
    - `views.py`

## Database setup

- `mysite/settings.py` > `DATABASES`
- For databases other than SQLite:
  - install the appropriate database bindings
  - change the following keys to match your database connection settings:
    - `ENGINE` - either `django.db.backends.sqlite3`, `django.db.backends.postgresql`, `django.db.backends.mysql`, or `django.db.backends.oracle`
      - other backends are also available
    - `NAME` - the name of your database
  - additional settings such as `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `HOST` must be added
  - create a database with `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
  - make sure that the database user provided has `create database` privileges
- Some of the applications in `mysite/settings.py` > `INSTALLED_APPS` make use of at least one database table, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them
  - `python manage.py migrate`
  - `migrate` command looks at the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the database settings in your `mysite/settings.py` file and the database migrations shipped with the apps

## Models and database

- Define models in `polls/models.py`
  - allows Django to
    - create a database schema (`CREATE TABLE` statements) for this app
    - create a Python database-access API for accessing `Question` and `Choice` objects
- Tell our project that the `polls` app is installed
  - `PollsConfig` class is in the `polls/apps.py` file, so its dotted path is `polls.apps.PollsConfig`
  - add that dotted path to the `mysite/settings.py` > `INSTALLED_APPS` setting
- Tell Django that you've made some changes to your models (in this case, you've made new ones) and that you'd like the changes to be stored as a _migration_
  - `python manage.py makemigrations polls`
- Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema)
  - migration for your new model is in the file `polls/migrations/0001_initial.py`
- See what SQL that migration would run
  - `python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001`
- Check for any problems in your project without making migrations or touching the database
  - `python manage.py check`
- Create model tables in your database
  - `python manage.py migrate`
- The `migrate` command takes all the migrations that haven't been applied and runs them against your database
  - Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called `django_migrations`
  - synchronizes the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database
  - lets you change your models over time, as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones
  - specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data
- Commit migrations to your version control system and ship them with your app
  - make your development easier
  - usable by other developers and in production

## Database API

- Invoke the Python shell
  - `python manage.py shell`
- Use the database API
  - see <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/queries/>

## Django Admin

- Create an admin user
  - `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Start the development server
  - `python manage.py runserver`
- Go to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/> on your browser
  - you should see a few types of editable content: groups and users - provided by `django.contrib.auth`, the authentication framework shipped by Django
- Make the poll app modifiable in the admin site
  - tell the admin site that `Question` objects have an admin interface
  - add `admin.site.register(Question)` to `polls/admin.py`
- The Questions admin form:
  - automatically generated from the `Question` model
  - different model field types (`DateTimeField`, `CharField`) correspond to the appropriate HTML input widget

## Views

- A "type" of Web page that generally serves a specific function and has a specific template
- Each view is represented by a Python function (or method, in the case of class-based views)
- To get from a URL to a view, Django uses 'URLconfs'
  - map URL patterns to views
  - see <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/urls/>
- When a request is made to, say, `/polls/34/`
  - Django will load the `mysite.urls` Python module
    - pointed to by `ROOT_URLCONF` in `mysite/settings.py`
  - finds the variable named `urlpatterns` and traverses the patterns in order
  - after finding the match at `polls/`, it strips off the matching text, `polls/`, and sends the remaining text, `34/`, to the `polls.urls` URLconf for further processing
    - `path("polls/", include("polls.urls"))`
  - there it matches `<int:question_id>/`, resulting in a call to the `detail()` view
    - `path("<int:question_id>/", views.detail, name="detail")`
- Each view is responsible for doing one of two things
  1. returning an `HttpResponse` object containing the content for the requested page, or
  2. raising an exception such as `Http404`

## Templates

- Your project's `mysite/settings.py` > `TEMPLATES` setting describes how Django will load and render templates
  - configures a `DjangoTemplates` backend whose `APP_DIRS` option is set to `True`
  - by convention `DjangoTemplates` looks for a `templates` subdirectory in each of the `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Create templates in `polls/templates/polls/<template>`, including all preceding subdirectories
  - refer to this template within Django as `polls/<template>`, e.g., `polls/index.html`
- Template namespacing
  - you might be able to get away with putting our templates directly in `polls/templates` (rather than creating another polls subdirectory)
  - Django will choose the first template it finds whose name matches
  - if you had a template with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them
  - the best way to avoid this problem is by namespacing them
    - by putting those templates inside another directory named for the application itself
- See <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/templates/>

## URLs

- Avoid hardcoding URLs in templates by making use of the `name` argument in the `path()` functions in the `polls.urls` module, along with the `{% url %}` template tag
  - `polls/urls.py`:
    - `path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail')`
  - `polls/index.html`:
    - `<a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a>`
- Namespace URL names to differentiate URL names between Django apps in a project
  - `polls/urls.py`:
    - `app_name = 'polls'`
  - `polls/index.html`:
    - `<a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">{{ question.question_text }}</a>`

## Forms

```
<form action="{% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}" method="post">
{% csrf_token %}
{% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
    <input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}">
    <label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br>
{% endfor %}
<input type="submit" value="Vote">
</form>
```

- `question` is passed in through the context in `views.py`
  - `render(request, "polls/detail.html", {"question": question})`
- `name` of each radio button is `choice`
- POST data is `choice=#` where `#` is the ID of the selected choice
- Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
  - all POST forms that target internal URLs should use the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag
- Receiving POST data
  - `request.POST['choice']`
    - a dictionary-like object that lets you access submitted data by key name
    - `request.GET` for accessing GET data in the same way
  - return `HttpResponseRedirect` after successfully dealing with POST data
    - prevents data from being posted twice if a user hits the Back button

## Generic Views

- For the common case of basic Web development:
  - getting data from the database according to a parameter passed in the URL
  - loading a template
  - returning the rendered template
- General
  - view: class-based
  - model: `model` attribute
  - template: `template_name` attribute
  - template context variable: `context_object_name` attribute
  - URLconf: `urlpatterns`
    - `path('', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index')`
    - `path('<int:pk>/', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail')`
- Detail view
  - display a detail page for a particular type of object
  - URLconf: primary key value captured from the URL to be called `pk`
  - template default: `<app name>/<model name>_detail.html`
  - context variable default: e.g., `question` if the model is `Question`
  - see `DetailView` in [`polls/views.py`](mysite/polls/views.py)
  - see <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#django.views.generic.detail.DetailView>
- List view
  - display a list of objects
  - template default: `<app name>/<model name>_list.html`
  - context variable default: e.g., `question_list` if the model is `Question`
  - see `IndexView` in [`polls/views.py`](mysite/polls/views.py)
  - see <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/class-based-views/generic-display/#django.views.generic.list.ListView>

## Testing

- The testing system will automatically find tests in any file whose name begins with `test`
- A special database is created for testing
  - reset for each test method
- Tests are identified by
  - subclass of the `django.test.TestCase` class
  - test methods - names begin with `test`
- Run tests
  - `python manage.py test <app name; optional>`
- See [`polls/tests.py`](mysite/polls/tests.py)
- See <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/testing/>
- Good rules-of-thumbs:
  - a separate `TestClass` for each model or view
  - a separate test method for each set of conditions you want to test
  - test method names that describe their function
- Django includes `LiveServerTestCase` to facilitate integration with tools like Selenium.
- Code coverage
  - install Coverage.py
    - `pip install coverage`
  - run
    - `coverage run --source='.' manage.py test`
  - report
    - `coverage report`

## Static Files

- `django.contrib.staticfiles`: collects static files from each of your applications (and any other places you specify) into a single location that can easily be served in production
- `STATICFILES_FINDERS` setting
  - a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources
  - defaults:
    - `django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder`
    - `django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder`
      - `static` subdirectory in each of the `INSTALLED_APPS`
      - with a stylesheet file in `polls/static/polls/style.css`, you can refer to this static file in Django as `polls/style.css`
      - static file namespacing works similarly to template namespacing
- The `{% static %}` template tag is not available for use in static files like your stylesheet which aren't generated by Django
  - always use relative paths to link your static files between each other, because then you can change `STATIC_URL` (used by the `static` template tag to generate its URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well
  - e.g., `background: white url("images/background.jpg")`

## Customising admin pages

- Customise the admin form by registering a model (e.g., `Question`) along with a `ModelAdmin` object in [polls/admin.py](mysite/polls/admin.py)
- Use the `fields` and `fieldsets` options in the `ModelAdmin` object to lay out fields on the admin form
- Use the `inlines` option to enable editing of related objects (models) on the same page as a parent model
- Use the `list_display` option to control which fields are displayed on the change list page (i.e., <http://localhost:8000/admin/polls/question/>)
- Use the `list_filter` option to activate filters in the right sidebar
- Use the `search_fields` option to add a search box
- Change lists provide pagination for free - default is to display 100 items per page
- To customise the admin look and feel
  - create a `templates` directory in your project directory (i.e., where `manage.py` is located)
  - in [mysite/settings.py](mysite/mysite/settings.py), add a `DIRS` option in the `TEMPLATES` setting to indicate the directories to check when loading Django templates
  - create a directory called `admin` inside `templates`
  - copy the template `admin/base_site.html` from Django's `django/contrib/admin/templates` into `admin`
    - run `python -c "import django; print(django.__path__)"` to see the location of Django source files
  - customise `base_site.html`
  - any of Django's default admin templates can be overridden as above
  - for complex applications that require modification of Djangos standard admin templates
    - modify the _application_'s templates rather than those in the _project_
    - you can include the application in any new project, and it would find the custom templates it needs
